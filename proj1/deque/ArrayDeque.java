         * emphasis.
         *
         * 1. The deque will be implemented in *circular topology* on array, which means once
         *    the array is *not null*, *addFirst* method will *loop back* to array, result
         *    in adding new items from back of the array to its front. eg, adding [1, 2, 3, 4]
         *    with addFirst method, the items stores like: [1, 4, 3, 2].
         *
         * 2. The method addLast just insert items in natural order, aka, adding [1, 2, 3, 4]
         *    with addLast will shape the array as [1, 2, 3, 4].
         *
         * 3. Variable _PHEAD always points to the *head* position of the array while _PTAIL
         *    always points to the *tail* position of the array.
         *
         * 4. Define that the *head* position refers to the position of item that *next addFirst*
         *    operation will insert in. Similarly, the *tail* position refers to the position
         *    of item that *next addLast* operation will insert in.
         *
         * 5. Each addFirst operation accounts for _PHEAD minus 1, symmetrically, each addLast
         *    operation accounts for _PTAIL plus 1.
         *
         * 6. At the beginning when array is of empty size, _PHEAD equals to _CAPACITY and
         *    _PTAIL equals to 0. Adding item to a null array is *considered both* addFirst
         *    and addLast operations, therefore, _PHEAD will minus 1 as well as _PTAIL will
         *    plus 1, and this is the *only occasion* of add-operation such that one operation
         *    accounts for two pointers changed.
         *
         * 7. The situation of remove operation can be inferred symmetrically.
         *
         * 8. One thing should be notice is that the purpose of setting _PHEAD and _PTAIL is to
         *    simplify our work on recording add/remove-operations, however, they can rarely be
         *    used directly. Consider a simple case:
         *      At the beginning we have _PHEAD equals to _CAPACITY and _PTAIL equals to 0, and
         *      then we do addLast(1), addLast(2). Now we have array like [1, 2, x, x, x, x, x, x,],
         *      "x" representing null. At this moment we have _PHEAD = 7 and _PTAIL = 2. Next,
         *      we do removeFirst() twice, 1 would be removed first with 2 coming second. But
         *      after remove operations, _PHEAD will equal to 9 as well as _PTAIL equals to 1(The
         *      last remove regarded both removeFirst and remove Last). Obviously, _PHEAD is neither
         *      within the bound since _CAPACITY equals to 8 nor can we locate the address of item
         *      1 and 2 through value of _PHEAD.
         *    Here we can see that the add/remove-operations don't promise to async with the true
         *    index to be inserted of the array. Actually the occasion of what is mentioned is just
         *    one possible case of all. What we can indeed use is the value of two pointers
         *    *modulo* _CAPACITY. It's easy to check the validation as you go back to case above.
         *
         * 9. According to existing analysis, we can easily drive to such an inequality about
         *    _PHEAD and _PTAIL:
         *      0 <= _PTAIL - 1 <= _PHEAD + 1
         *
         * 10. If we get that _PTAIL â‰¡ _PHEAD(mod _CAPACITY), then there must be array is of full
         *    size or empty.
